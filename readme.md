The ORM of choice is Mongoose/MongoDB. 

- Create a basic routing mechanism for HTTP requests

Express and Node.js on the Backend were used for 

- Authenticate a userâ€™s access to a route

JWT token via the JsonWebToken package were used. 

- Respond to a request in a consistent and logical manner

- Test your work with both unit tests and integration tests.
Mocha and Chai were used to test all the routes.
